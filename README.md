# partAdvisorBackend
Backend codes for partAdvisor.

*** Added final presentation for software design patterns.
**** Back-end is built with MCV architecture pattern so whenever I tried to fit in a desing pattern it caused a whole mess, needed major changes which eleminates the MCV architecture. All the design patterns kept in front-end and can be seen under partAdvisor_final_sunum.pdf file. (Last 3 pages of the presentation)
